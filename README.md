# BaronSmiteSimulator
This is a Baron Smite Simulator. This program is mostly made for people who play league of legends.
In line 30, that is the directory I use on my local repository to display the image associated with the program, so that
directory must be the directory of the Baronnasoor.jpg file.
It is simple to play the game, you can choose a harder difficulty, and the amount of damage you can do as well as
how much health Baron(the monster in the game) has. In league, 2 teams contest to steal baron, who ever smites baron last gets the win. So you need to time it on time and keep an eye on how much health he has in order to deal the final fatal blow, otherwise you will lose.
